datasets:
    DIV2K - djr super resolution
    WiderFace


upsampling:
    - bilinear
    - ConvTranspose3d
    - sub-pixel convolution with ICNR initialisation

Ideas:
    - ResNet as encoder (pretrained). fastis generages decoder.
        - Freeze encoder and the first time
    - SuggleNet updampling
    ? feature loss ?s

networks:
    UNet

    epoch3: loss = 27891520.551757812
    epoch5: loss = 27679750.163085938
    
    
Coloriser:
    - Save visalisations
    - Try ResNet as backbone
